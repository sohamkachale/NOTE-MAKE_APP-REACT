# NotesApp â€“ React Notes App

## Overview
NotesApp is an advanced feature-rich notes manager and organizer built with React. It includes secure authentication, theme switching (light/dark mode), in-browser data storage, intuitive search and sort, and smooth animated transitions for productivity. The app uses modern React patterns, the Context API for state management, and Framer Motion for animation.

- **Notes Management:** Create, edit, delete, and copy notes. All notes are persisted in local storage and tied to user sessions.
- **Search and Sort:** Real-time search filtering and sorting options (by update, creation date, or title).
- **Theme Toggle:** Switch seamlessly between light and dark themes, with automatic preference saving.
- **Responsive UI:** Modern, mobile-friendly design with animated transitions and Framer Motion effects.
- **Enhanced UX:** Error and success messages, input validation, password visibility toggles, and intuitive gestures.
- **Customizable:** CSS variables and scalable styles for easy theming and extension.
